## General-info
The program will generate a random password given a few inputs from the user. It will ask how long the password should be. If its between 8 and 128 it will proceed. If not it will tell the user to make it between  and 128 and then restart the prompt. Then it will ask what characters the password should be made of. The user will select what characters and then it will generate a password for the user.
